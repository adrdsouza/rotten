# Single Landing Page Implementation Plan

## Overview
Convert the current homepage + shop page into a single, high-performance landing page that tells the complete brand story and enables product selection in one seamless experience.

## Performance Strategy ðŸš€

### Loading Priorities
1. **Hero Section**: Immediate load (LCP < 1s)
2. **Story Section**: Lazy load after hero complete
3. **Product Selection**: Load on user intent (SHOP button click or scroll proximity)
4. **Video Section**: Lazy load when in viewport
5. **GraphQL Data**: Progressive loading based on user interaction

### Qwik Best Practices
- Use `routeLoader$` for minimal initial data only
- Leverage `useVisibleTask$` for progressive loading
- Implement proper cleanup with AbortController
- Use signals for reactive state management
- Minimize initial bundle size

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section (Immediate Load)
**Content:**
- "One Shirt. 18 Options. Zero Bullshit."
- "If it's not the softest shirt you've ever felt, we'll pay you back"
- SHOP button with smooth scroll to #product-selection

**Performance:**
- Preloaded hero images (multiple formats: AVIF, WebP, JPEG)
- Critical CSS inline
- Minimal JavaScript

**User Flow:**
- Ready buyers: Click SHOP â†’ Jump to products
- Browsers: Natural scroll to story

### 2. Story Section (Lazy Load)
**Content:**
- "Three Years in the Making"
- Product development story
- Peach skin finish details
- "Experience the Perfect Shirt" CTA â†’ scroll to products

**Performance:**
- Load after hero complete or on scroll
- Lazy load images when section becomes visible
- Progressive enhancement

### 3. Product Selection Section (On-Demand Load)
**Content:**
- Style selection (Short Sleeves $70 / Long Sleeves $80)
- Progressive size/color selector (appears after style chosen)
- Product images and variant selection
- Add to cart functionality

**Performance:**
- Load basic style data in route loader
- Full product data loads on user intent:
  - SHOP button click
  - Scroll within 200px of section
- Reuse existing progressive loading pattern from shop page
- Assets load only after style selection

**User Experience:**
- Same progressive disclosure as current shop page
- Style â†’ Size â†’ Color â†’ Add to Cart
- Loading states for each step

### 4. Sustainability Video Section (Viewport Load)
**Content:**
- "Conscious consumption over mindless waste"
- Background video with overlay
- "Fast fashion dumps 92 million tons..." messaging
- Ethically made in India story

**Performance:**
- Load only when in viewport (Intersection Observer)
- Video with `preload="none"`
- Fallback image for slow connections

### 5. Guarantee Section (Static)
**Content:**
- Reworked money-back guarantee
- Remove misleading elements
- Specific policy details

**Performance:**
- Static content, minimal resources

## Technical Implementation

### Route Loader Strategy
```typescript
export const useHomepageLoader = routeLoader$(async () => {
  return {
    heroData: {
      // Minimal hero content
    },
    basicStyles: await getShirtStylesForSelection(), // Names, prices only
  };
});
```

### Progressive Loading Signals
```typescript
const heroLoaded = useSignal(false);
const storyVisible = useSignal(false);
const productSectionReady = useSignal(false);
const userShowedIntent = useSignal(false);
const videoSectionVisible = useSignal(false);
```

### User Intent Detection
- **SHOP Button Click**: Immediate product data load + scroll
- **Scroll Proximity**: Preload when within 200px of product section
- **Natural Scroll**: Progressive section loading

### GraphQL Loading Strategy
1. **Route Loader**: Basic style info only (getShirtStylesForSelection)
2. **User Intent**: Full product data (getBatchedProductsForShop)
3. **Style Selection**: Variant data and assets (existing pattern)
4. **No Blocking**: All GraphQL after initial render

## File Structure

### Primary Files to Modify
- `frontend/src/routes/index.tsx` - Main implementation
- Keep existing shop page as backup/reference

### Components to Reuse
- Product selection logic from shop page
- Variant selector components
- Cart functionality
- Image optimization components

### New Components Needed
- Smooth scroll utility
- Section lazy loading wrapper
- Video lazy loading component

## Performance Targets

### Core Web Vitals
- **LCP**: < 1.0s (hero section only)
- **FID**: < 100ms (minimal initial JS)
- **CLS**: < 0.1 (proper image sizing)

### Loading Metrics
- **Initial Bundle**: < 50KB
- **Hero Images**: Preloaded, optimized
- **GraphQL**: Zero blocking queries
- **Time to Interactive**: < 2s

## User Experience Flow

### Fast Path (Ready Buyers)
1. Land on hero
2. Click SHOP button
3. Product data loads + smooth scroll to selection
4. Choose style â†’ size â†’ color â†’ add to cart

### Story Path (Need Convincing)
1. Land on hero
2. Scroll to read story
3. Get convinced by brand narrative
4. Reach product selection (data already loaded)
5. Choose style â†’ size â†’ color â†’ add to cart

### Both Paths Converge
- Same product selection experience
- Same cart functionality
- Same checkout flow

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup
1. Create backup of current homepage
2. Set up new route loader with minimal data
3. Implement basic page structure

### Phase 2: Hero Section
1. Implement immediate hero loading
2. Add smooth scroll functionality
3. Optimize hero images and critical CSS

### Phase 3: Progressive Loading
1. Add story section lazy loading
2. Implement product section on-demand loading
3. Add video section viewport loading

### Phase 4: Integration
1. Merge product selection from shop page
2. Implement progressive disclosure
3. Connect cart functionality

### Phase 5: Optimization
1. Performance testing and optimization
2. Analytics implementation
3. A/B testing setup

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- LCP improvement: Target < 1s
- Conversion rate increase: Target 20-35%
- Bounce rate reduction: Target 15-25%

### User Behavior
- Time on page increase
- Scroll depth improvement
- Product selection completion rate

### Business Impact
- Higher conversion rates
- Reduced cart abandonment
