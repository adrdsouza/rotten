# ðŸ”’ Payment Security Fixes Documentation

This document outlines the critical security fixes implemented to address vulnerabilities in the frontend order placement and payment flow.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ðŸš¨ Order ID Management Security Flaw

**Problem**: The payment component retrieved order information from global state without validating the specific order ID, which could result in processing payments for the wrong customer's order.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `Payment.tsx` to accept specific order details as props instead of relying on global state
- Added order validation in `StripePayment.tsx` before processing payments
- Implemented explicit order ID validation throughout the payment flow

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/src/components/payment/Payment.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/payment/StripePayment.tsx`
- `frontend/src/routes/checkout/index.tsx`

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD (INSECURE): Getting order from global state
const activeOrder = await getActiveOrderQuery();

// NEW (SECURE): Using specific order details passed as props
interface PaymentProps {
  orderDetails?: {
    id: string;
    code: string;
    totalWithTax: number;
    customer?: { emailAddress?: string; };
  } | null;
}
```

### 2. ðŸš¨ Non-Standard Stripe Implementation

**Problem**: The current Stripe integration used a "pre-order" pattern that didn't follow official Stripe best practices.

**Solution**: 
- Created `SecureStripePaymentService.ts` implementing official Stripe best practices
- Added `SecureStripePayment.tsx` component following Stripe's recommended security guidelines
- Implemented proper payment intent creation AFTER order creation
- Added secure payment intent creation method in backend

**Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/services/SecureStripePaymentService.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/payment/SecureStripePayment.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/plugins/stripe-pre-order/stripe-pre-order.plugin.ts`

**Key Improvements**:
```typescript
// NEW SECURE METHOD: Create payment intent with order validation
async createSecureStripePaymentIntent(
  orderId: string,
  orderCode: string,
  amount: number,
  currency: string,
  customerEmail?: string
): Promise<PaymentIntentResult>
```

### 3. ðŸš¨ Payment Intent Amount Validation

**Problem**: Payment intents were created with estimated amounts from cart calculation, with insufficient validation that the final payment matched the actual order total.

**Solution**:
- Added `getCurrentPaymentIntentAmount()` utility function
- Implemented payment amount validation before processing
- Added metadata validation to ensure payment intent matches order
- Created comprehensive validation in `SecureStripePaymentService`

**Key Validations Added**:
```typescript
// Validate payment amount matches order total
const currentPaymentIntentAmount = await getCurrentPaymentIntentAmount(clientSecret, stripe);
if (currentPaymentIntentAmount !== order.totalWithTax) {
  throw new Error(`Payment amount mismatch`);
}

// Validate order state
if (order.state !== 'ArrangingPayment') {
  throw new Error(`Order not ready for payment`);
}

// Validate order has line items
if (!order.lines || order.lines.length === 0) {
  throw new Error('Order has no items to pay for');
}
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Explicit Order Validation
- All payment processing now requires explicit order details
- No reliance on global state for critical payment information
- Comprehensive order validation before payment processing

### 2. Amount Verification
- Payment intent amounts must exactly match order totals
- Currency validation between payment intent and order
- Metadata validation to ensure payment intent belongs to correct order

### 3. State Validation
- Orders must be in `ArrangingPayment` state before payment
- Line items validation to ensure order has products
- Customer information validation where required

### 4. Stripe Best Practices
- Payment intents created AFTER order creation (not before)
- Proper error handling and validation
- Secure client secret handling
- Official Stripe Elements integration

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `frontend/src/tests/payment-security.test.ts` covering:

- Order validation scenarios
- Payment intent validation
- Amount mismatch detection
- Currency validation
- Metadata validation
- Security best practices compliance

## Migration Guide

### For New Implementations
Use the new `SecureStripePayment` component:

```typescript
import SecureStripePayment from '~/components/payment/SecureStripePayment';

// In your checkout component
<SecureStripePayment
  order={specificOrder}
  onSuccess$={handleSuccess}
  onError$={handleError}
/>
```

### For Existing Implementations
Update the existing `Payment` component usage:

```typescript
// OLD
<Payment triggerStripeSignal={signal} />

// NEW
<Payment 
  triggerStripeSignal={signal}
  orderDetails={{
    id: order.id,
    code: order.code,
    totalWithTax: order.totalWithTax,
    customer: order.customer
  }}
/>
```

## Backend Changes

### New Secure Mutation
Added `createSecureStripePaymentIntent` mutation that requires order validation:

```graphql
mutation CreateSecureStripePaymentIntent(
  $orderId: String!
  $orderCode: String!
  $amount: Int!
  $currency: String!
  $customerEmail: String
) {
  createSecureStripePaymentIntent(
    orderId: $orderId
    orderCode: $orderCode
    amount: $amount
    currency: $currency
    customerEmail: $customerEmail
  ) {
    clientSecret
    paymentIntentId
    amount
    currency
  }
}
```

## Security Impact

These fixes address the following security risks:

1. **Wrong Order Payment**: Eliminated risk of processing payments for incorrect orders
2. **Amount Manipulation**: Prevented payment amount mismatches
3. **State Confusion**: Ensured payments only processed for valid order states
4. **Race Conditions**: Reduced race condition risks through explicit validation

## Monitoring and Alerts

Consider implementing monitoring for:
- Payment amount mismatches
- Invalid order state transitions
- Failed payment validations
- Metadata validation failures

## Future Improvements

1. Implement webhook validation for payment confirmations
2. Add payment intent expiration handling
3. Implement payment retry mechanisms with proper validation
4. Add comprehensive audit logging for payment security events

**Note**: The legacy `createPreOrderStripePaymentIntent` method is kept for backward compatibility but marked as deprecated. New implementations should use `createSecureStripePaymentIntent`.
