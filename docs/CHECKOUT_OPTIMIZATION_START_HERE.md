## 📋 Quick Context

### What Was Done (Phase 1)

1. ✅ **Fixed 3 Qwik anti-patterns in cart components**
   - CartTotals.tsx - Removed trigger pattern
   - Cart.tsx - Converted to useComputed$
   - ConditionalCart.tsx - Switched to useResource$

2. ✅ **Added comprehensive timing logs**
   - 15+ timing checkpoints in Place Order flow
   - Detailed Stripe payment timing
   - Performance bottlenecks identified

3. ✅ **Analyzed performance data**
   - Total checkout time: ~8.5 seconds
   - Identified 2 major bottlenecks
   - Created optimization roadmap

### Current Performance

**Before Priority 1 Optimization:**
```
Total: 8.5 seconds from Place Order to Confirmation

Breakdown:
├─ Address Submission: 2,503ms (34%) 🔴 BOTTLENECK #1
├─ PaymentIntent Update: 2,268ms (31%) 🔴 BOTTLENECK #2
├─ Cart Conversion: 1,309ms (18%)
├─ Stripe Payment: 1,207ms (16%) ✅ Already good
└─ Other: 1,213ms (14%)
```

**After Priority 1 Optimization (Current):**
```
Total: ~7.0 seconds from Place Order to Confirmation (17% faster)

Breakdown:
├─ Address Submission: 2,503ms (36%) 🔴 BOTTLENECK #1 (NEXT)
├─ PaymentIntent Update: ~600ms (9%) ✅ OPTIMIZED (saved 1.67s)
├─ Cart Conversion: 1,309ms (19%)
├─ Stripe Payment: 1,207ms (17%) ✅ Already good
└─ Other: 1,213ms (17%)
```

## 🎯 Phase 2: Performance Optimization (IN PROGRESS)

### Goal: Reduce checkout time from 8.5s to 5.5s (35% faster)

### ✅ Priority 1: Combine PaymentIntent Updates (COMPLETE - Saved 1.5s)

**Status:** ✅ Complete and Deployed (2025-10-09)

**What Was Done:**
- Created new backend mutation `updatePaymentIntentWithOrder` that combines amount and metadata updates
- Added new method to `StripePaymentService.ts`
- Updated checkout flow to use combined method
- Ran codegen and deployed to production

**Results:**
- Before: 2,268ms (1,053ms + 1,214ms)
- After: ~600ms (single API call)
- **Savings: ~1,668ms (1.67 seconds)**

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `backend/src/plugins/stripe-extension/stripe-extension.plugin.ts` (new mutation)
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/StripePaymentService.ts` (new method)
- ✅ `frontend/src/routes/checkout/index.tsx` (updated flow)

**Documentation:**
- See `docs/checkout-optimization-priority1-complete.md` for full details

### 🎯 Priority 2: Optimize Address Submission (IN PROGRESS - Save 1.5s)

**Status:** 🔍 Analysis Phase - Timing Logs Added

**Current Problem:**
```typescript
// Address submission taking 2,104ms (from live console logs)
📍 Address submission: 2,104ms

Suspected bottleneck:
- Multiple sequential getActiveOrderQuery() calls (4-6 queries)
- Customer authentication checks
- Order state verification
- THEN parallel address processing
```

**Analysis Findings:**
- CheckoutOptimizationService is identical to reference code (damn/)
- The parallel processing itself is already optimized
- The slowness is in the SETUP queries before parallel processing
- Added comprehensive timing logs to identify exact bottleneck

**Documentation:**
- See `docs/address-submission-analysis.md` for full analysis

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Batch GraphQL Mutations**
```typescript
// Create a single GraphQL mutation that does everything
mutation SetOrderAddressesAndShipping($input: OrderAddressInput!) {
  setOrderCustomer(input: $input.customer)
  setOrderShippingAddress(input: $input.shippingAddress)
  setOrderBillingAddress(input: $input.billingAddress)
  setOrderShippingMethod(shippingMethodId: $input.shippingMethodId)
}

// Expected time: ~1,000ms (save 1,503ms)
```

**Option B: Pre-validate and Cache**
```typescript
// Cache shipping methods on page load
// Pre-validate addresses before submission
// Only submit when all data is ready

// Expected time: ~1,200ms (save 1,303ms)
```

**Files to modify:**
- `frontend/src/services/CheckoutOptimizationService.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/checkout/CheckoutAddresses.tsx` (line 615 - window object)
- Backend: Create batched mutation resolver
