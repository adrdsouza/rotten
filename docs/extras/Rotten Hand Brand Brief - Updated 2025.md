## Core Brand Message: Why Buy Garbage?

### **The Fashion Waste Crisis**
The fashion industry is the second-most polluting industry in the world. Fast fashion brands release 52 "seasons" per year, creating clothes designed to fall apart after a few washes. The Netflix documentary "The True Cost" exposes how this system exploits workers and destroys the environment.

**The Numbers:**
- Average garment is worn only 7 times before disposal
- 85% of textiles end up in landfills each year
- Fast fashion workers earn $3/day in unsafe conditions
- 2,700 liters of water needed for one cotton t-shirt

### **Our Solution: Conscious Consumption**
Instead of 52 seasons of garbage, we offer 2 perfect pieces built to last decades.

**Why Two Products?**
- **Creates Focus:** No decision fatigue, just perfect choices
- **Builds Quality:** 100% of our energy goes into perfection
- **Demonstrates Values:** Conscious consumption over mindless accumulation
- **Enables Longevity:** Built to last decades, not seasons

## Sustainable Innovation: Zero Waste Design

### **Tagua Nut Buttons: Nature's Ivory**
Your buttons grew on a tree. Tagua nuts from South American rainforests are naturally ivory-colored, incredibly durable, and completely renewable. While fast fashion uses plastic buttons that will outlast us all in landfills, we chose buttons that come from nature and return to it.

**It costs us 10x more. It's worth 100x more.**

### **Waste-to-Wonder Packaging**
Your shirt arrives in packaging that used to be waste:
- **Garment bags:** Made from reclaimed industrial textile waste
- **Mailers:** 100% compostable, not just "biodegradable"
- **Care cards:** Hemp paper with seed paper bookmark
- **Message:** "This bag will biodegrade. Your shirt will not."
