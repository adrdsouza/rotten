# Local Cart Coupon Integration – Implementation Summary

## Overview

The local cart mode allows users to apply and remove coupons client-side, without requiring a backend order. This ensures a seamless offline or guest checkout experience, with all coupon logic and state managed locally in the browser.

## Core Components & Services

### 1. `LocalCartService` Singleton

- **Purpose:** Centralized service for managing cart state, including coupon application and removal, in local cart mode.
- **Coupon Logic:**
  - `applyCoupon(code: string)`: Validates and applies a coupon to the local cart, updating discounts and totals.
  - `removeCoupon()`: Removes any applied coupon, reverting discounts and updating totals.
- **State Management:** Updates are propagated through a `setLocalCart` callback, ensuring UI reactivity.

### 2. `CartTotals.tsx` Component

- **Coupon Input UI:**
  - Provides an input field for users to enter a coupon code.
  - Users can submit via Enter key or button click.
- **Application/Removal Flow:**
  - On coupon apply:
    - Calls `LocalCartService.getInstance().applyCoupon(code)`.
    - Updates local cart state and displays any errors via the `Alert` component.
  - On coupon removal:
    - Calls `LocalCartService.getInstance().removeCoupon()`.
    - Updates local cart state and clears error messages.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Displays error messages using the `Alert` component (with only the `message` prop).
- **Display Logic:**
  - All price displays (subtotal, shipping, discounts, total) use values from `localCart.localCart` and are formatted with `formatPrice`.
  - Discounts are shown only if a coupon is applied and the discount amount is greater than zero.

## TypeScript & Serialization Compliance

- **All event handlers** (coupon apply/remove) are wrapped with Qwik’s `$()` to ensure proper serialization.
- **Type corrections**:
  - All property accesses use `localCart.localCart?.subTotal`, `localCart.localCart?.appliedCoupon`, etc., to match the actual local cart structure.
  - Removed any invalid prop usage (e.g., `readonly` on `CartTotals`, `type` on `Alert`, `price` on `CartPrice`).

---

## UI/UX Details

- **Reactive Updates:** The UI updates immediately when a coupon is applied or removed, reflecting new totals and discounts.
- **Manual & Button Submission:** Coupon codes can be applied by pressing Enter or clicking the apply button.
- **Error Feedback:** Any coupon application error is displayed instantly to the user.

---

## Testing & Validation

- **Manual Testing:** Coupon application/removal and discount display have been manually tested in local cart mode for accuracy and error handling.
- **TypeScript Checks:** All TypeScript errors related to coupon logic and prop usage have been resolved.

## Summary

The local cart coupon integration is now robust, user-friendly, and TypeScript-safe, supporting all essential coupon workflows in offline/local cart scenarios.
