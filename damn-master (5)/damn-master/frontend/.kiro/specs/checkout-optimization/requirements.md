# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the checkout page and place order functionality to improve performance, reduce network traffic, and enhance user experience. The optimization targets GraphQL query efficiency, parallel processing implementation, caching strategies, and address form submission improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the checkout page to load quickly, so that I can complete my purchase without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer navigates to the checkout page THEN the system SHALL load order data using optimized GraphQL fragments that reduce payload size by at least 50%
2. WHEN the checkout page requests order data THEN the system SHALL use the CheckoutOrderFragment instead of CustomOrderDetailFragment
3. WHEN order data is fetched THEN the system SHALL exclude unnecessary fields like product assets, options, and detailed variant information
4. WHEN the checkout page loads THEN the response time SHALL be improved compared to the current implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want my order to be processed quickly when I click place order, so that I don't have to wait unnecessarily long.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer clicks the place order button THEN the system SHALL execute address submission, shipping method setting, and order state transition in parallel
2. WHEN parallel operations are executed THEN the system SHALL use Promise.allSettled to handle all operations concurrently
3. WHEN any parallel operation fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without blocking other operations
4. WHEN all operations complete THEN the total processing time SHALL be reduced compared to sequential execution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the checkout process to be responsive when I navigate between steps, so that I have a smooth shopping experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer navigates between checkout steps THEN the system SHALL cache order data for 2 minutes to avoid unnecessary API calls
2. WHEN cached data is available and valid THEN the system SHALL use cached data instead of making new API requests
3. WHEN the cache exceeds 20 entries THEN the system SHALL remove the oldest entries to maintain performance
4. WHEN cached data expires THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh data and update the cache

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want accurate stock information during checkout, so that I know if my items are still available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stock levels need to be refreshed THEN the system SHALL use the lighter productVariants query instead of full product queries
2. WHEN multiple products need stock refresh THEN the system SHALL fetch stock data in parallel using Promise.all
3. WHEN a product variant is not found THEN the system SHALL set stock level to 0 and update the last stock check timestamp
4. WHEN stock refresh fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to the local stock refresh method

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a customer, I want clear feedback when address submission fails, so that I can correct any issues and retry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN address submission encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user
2. WHEN address submission fails THEN the system SHALL allow the customer to retry the submission
3. WHEN address submission is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators to prevent multiple submissions
4. WHEN address submission completes successfully THEN the system SHALL proceed to the next checkout step

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the checkout optimizations to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality is not broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing checkout functionality
2. WHEN GraphQL queries fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms to ensure checkout completion
3. WHEN caching is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with direct API calls
4. WHEN parallel processing encounters issues THEN the system SHALL handle errors without breaking the checkout flow

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the optimizations to follow best practices, so that the code is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing optimizations THEN the system SHALL follow Qwik application best practices including proper signal usage
2. WHEN caching is implemented THEN the system SHALL include proper cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
3. WHEN parallel operations are used THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling to prevent race conditions
4. WHEN GraphQL fragments are created THEN the system SHALL include only necessary fields for the specific use case
