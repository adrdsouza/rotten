# Product Page GraphQL Analysis

## Overview
The product page displays detailed information about a specific product, including images, description, variants, and pricing. It handles product display, variant selection, and adding items to the cart. The page uses a single primary GraphQL query to fetch all necessary product data.

## GraphQL Operations

### 1. Product Query
- **Operation Type**: Query
- **Operation Name**: `product`
- **Trigger**: Product page initialization
- **Frequency**: Once per product page view

#### Fields Queried:
```graphql
query product($slug: String, $id: ID) {
  product(slug: $slug, id: $id) {
    ...DetailedProductFragment
  }
}

fragment DetailedProductFragment on Product {
  id
  name
  slug
  description
  facetValues {
    facet {
      id
      code
      name
    }
    id
    code
    name
  }
  featuredAsset {
    id
    preview
  }
  assets {
    id
    preview
  }
  variants {
    id
    name
    priceWithTax
    currencyCode
    sku
    stockLevel
    customFields {
      salePrice
      preOrderPrice
      shipDate
    }
  }
}
```

#### Parameters:
- `slug`: Product slug for lookup
- `id`: Product ID (alternative lookup method)

#### Observations:
1. Fetches complete product information including all variants
2. Gets all product images (assets) and featured asset
3. Retrieves product description and name
4. Includes facet values for categorization
5. Queries variant-specific information including custom fields
6. Gets stock levels for all variants

## Field Usage Analysis

### Definitely Used Fields:
- `id`: For product identification and variant selection
- `name`: Product title display
- `slug`: URL generation and navigation
- `description`: Product description display
- `featuredAsset`: Main product image display
- `assets`: Product gallery images
- `variants`: Variant selection and display
- `variants[*].id`: Variant identification for selection
- `variants[*].name`: Variant name display
- `variants[*].priceWithTax`: Price display
- `variants[*].currencyCode`: Price formatting
- `variants[*].sku`: Internal product identification
- `variants[*].stockLevel`: Stock status and availability display
- `variants[*].customFields`: Sale/pre-order information display
- `variants[*].customFields.salePrice`: Sale price display
- `variants[*].customFields.preOrderPrice`: Pre-order price display
- `variants[*].customFields.shipDate`: Pre-order ship date display

### Potentially Unused Fields:
- `facetValues`: May be used for SEO or filtering but not directly displayed
- `facetValues[*].facet`: Detailed facet information
- `facetValues[*].code`: Facet value code
- `variants[*].currencyCode`: Currency is consistent across site, may not need per-variant storage

## Performance Considerations

1. **Asset Loading**: The query fetches all product assets at once, which provides a complete gallery but may impact initial load time for products with many images
2. **Variant Data**: All variants are fetched regardless of which one is selected, which is necessary for the variant selection UI but may transfer more data than needed for simple views
3. **Custom Fields**: Custom fields are queried for all variants even if only some variants have sale or pre-order pricing
4. **Facet Values**: Facet values are fetched but may not be used on the product page itself
5. **Stock Refresh**: The page refreshes stock levels when it becomes visible, using the same comprehensive query

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Asset Loading Optimization
- **Issue**: All assets are loaded at once regardless of immediate need
- **Recommendation**: Implement progressive loading or pagination for product galleries with many images
- **Potential Savings**: Reduce initial payload size for products with large image galleries

### 2. Variant Data Optimization
- **Issue**: All variant data is fetched even when only basic information is needed for initial display
- **Recommendation**: Consider a lighter-weight variant fragment for initial load with detailed data fetched on demand
- **Potential Savings**: Reduce data transfer for products with many variants

### 3. Facet Value Optimization
- **Issue**: Facet values are queried but may not be used on the product page
- **Recommendation**: Remove facet values from the product query if not used in the UI
- **Potential Savings**: Small reduction in data transfer

### 4. Custom Fields Optimization
- **Issue**: Custom fields are queried for all variants regardless of whether they're used
- **Recommendation**: Only query custom fields when needed for display (e.g., when a variant has sale or pre-order status)
- **Potential Savings**: Minor reduction in data transfer

### 5. Stock Level Refresh Optimization
- **Issue**: The stock refresh operation uses the same comprehensive query
- **Recommendation**: Create a lightweight query that only fetches stock levels for variants
- **Potential Savings**: Significant reduction in data transfer for stock refresh operations

## Recommendations

1. **Create a Lightweight Stock Refresh Query**: Implement a dedicated query for refreshing stock levels that only fetches variant IDs and stock levels
2. **Implement Progressive Image Loading**: For products with many images, consider loading only the first few assets initially and loading more on demand
3. **Optimize Variant Loading**: Consider a two-stage approach where basic variant information is loaded first with detailed information fetched on variant selection
4. **Remove Unused Fields**: Audit and remove facet values from the product query if they're not used in the product page UI
5. **Add Caching Strategy**: Implement caching for product data to reduce repeated queries for the same product
6. **Consider Pagination for Large Galleries**: For products with extensive image galleries, implement pagination or lazy loading

## Comparison with Other Pages

Unlike the cart and checkout pages which use the comprehensive `CustomOrderDetail` fragment for multiple operations, the product page uses a more focused query pattern. This is appropriate since the product page has a single primary data requirement rather than multiple related operations.

The product page query is more similar to the search page queries in that it fetches specific data for display rather than a complete object graph for manipulation.
