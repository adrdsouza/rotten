# Checkout Page GraphQL Analysis

## Unused/Unreferenced Fields
After thorough analysis, most fields are used in the checkout implementation:

**Definitely Used:**
- All address fields: For display and form population
- All customer fields: For display and form population
- All order fields: For confirmation display
- All line item fields: For order summary
- Payment fields: For payment method display
- Tax and discount fields: For order summary

**Potentially Unused:**
- `active`: Order is by definition active in checkout
- `createdAt`: Not directly displayed
- Some fields in `taxSummary`: May not be displayed in current UI
- `__typename`: GraphQL type information

## Performance Considerations
1. The `CustomOrderDetail` fragment is reused extensively, ensuring consistency but potentially transferring more data than needed for some operations
2. Multiple mutations are chained during checkout, which could be optimized
3. Order confirmation page fetches complete order data which is appropriate for that context
4. Payment verification is handled separately for Sezzle, which is specific to that payment provider

## Recommendations
1. Consider implementing more granular mutations for specific checkout steps to reduce data transfer
2. Add better error handling and user feedback for failed checkout steps
3. Implement loading states for better user experience during checkout operations
4. Consider optimizing the order confirmation query to fetch only the data needed for display
5. Add analytics tracking for checkout funnel optimization
6. Implement proper form validation before making GraphQL requests to reduce unnecessary API calls
