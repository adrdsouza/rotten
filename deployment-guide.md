# Stripe Payment Settlement Fix - Deployment Guide

## What Was Completed Locally

### âœ… Backend Changes
- **Removed immediate settlement** from `linkPaymentIntentToOrder` function
- **Created new GraphQL mutation** `settleStripePayment` with Stripe API verification
- **Implemented settlement service** with proper validation and idempotency
- **Added Stripe API integration** for PaymentIntent status verification
- **Enhanced logging and monitoring** throughout the payment flow
- **Implemented comprehensive error handling** with retry mechanisms

### âœ… Frontend Changes
- **Updated payment confirmation flow** to call `settleStripePayment` after Stripe confirmation
- **Removed immediate settlement calls** from frontend
- **Added proper error handling** and user feedback for settlement failures
- **Implemented retry mechanism** for failed settlement attempts

### âœ… Testing Completed
- Successful payment flow: creation â†’ linking â†’ confirmation â†’ verification â†’ settlement
- Failed payment handling: orders stay in ArrangingPayment state
- API failure scenarios with proper error handling and retries
- Concurrent settlement protection with idempotency checks

## What Needs to Be Done on Server

### ðŸ”„ Deployment Steps

1. **Pull latest code from git**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any new packages were added)
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Restart backend services**
   ```bash
   # Stop current processes
   pm2 stop all
   
   # Start with updated code
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
   ```

4. **Verify Stripe API configuration**
   - Ensure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set
   - Confirm API key has proper permissions for PaymentIntent retrieval
   - Test API connectivity with a simple Stripe API call

### ðŸ§ª Server Testing Required

1. **Test the new settlement flow**
   - Create a test order and payment
   - Verify PaymentIntent is linked but not immediately settled
   - Complete payment on Stripe side
   - Confirm settlement happens via API verification

2. **Monitor logs for errors**
   - Check for any Stripe API connection issues
   - Verify settlement logging is working correctly
   - Watch for any unexpected errors in the new flow

3. **Test error scenarios**
   - Simulate Stripe API failures
   - Test with invalid PaymentIntent IDs
   - Verify retry mechanisms work as expected

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Task

- [ ] **Task 9: Update documentation and remove webhook dependencies**
  - Document the new settlement flow and API requirements
  - Update plugin documentation to reflect API-based verification
  - Create troubleshooting guide for settlement issues
  - Remove any webhook-related configuration documentation

### ðŸš¨ Important Notes

- **No webhook configuration needed** - the new flow uses direct Stripe API calls
- **Existing orders are not affected** - only new payments will use the new flow
- **Rollback plan**: If issues occur, the previous webhook-based code can be restored from git history
- **Monitor closely** for the first few hours after deployment to catch any unexpected issues

### ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

- Payments settle correctly after Stripe confirmation
- No duplicate settlements occur
- Error handling works properly for failed payments
- Logs show clear payment lifecycle tracking
- No webhook-related errors in logs
